# Wannabe T9 Engine

Simple project showing minimal examples of a few technologies used in JS development.

To start the app, just run `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios` and `yarn start`

Server can be started by running `yarn start-server`

Might need to run `yarn reverse-port` as well for Android testing.
